# Differential Equation Solver

In this repository I am going to explore some techniques to solve some differential equations, first `Ordinary Differential Equations` (ODEs) and then `Partial Differential Equations` (PDEs).

## What is a differential equation?

A differential equation is any equation that involves derivatives and functions, the simplest example is the equation:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \ \ \ x \in \R$$

which has the solution

$$y= \int$$
